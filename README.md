This is a simple puzzle game about arithmetic. It was made in C++ using the
SDL2 graphics library. New levels are being made continuously.



How to Install:

This game uses SDL2 libraries, which you will need to install.


For Ubuntu:

cd into the mazematics directory

In a terminal run:

sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev

sudo apt-get install libsdl2-image-dev

sudo apt-get install libsdl2-ttf-dev

cd src

make

./maze


For ubuntu, there is a shell script called install.sh that does this. Simply
run it with sudo, to do all of the above.

For other Unix systems, just use your own package manager to install SDL
libraries.


Instructions to play can be found in the game.
